# Microsongs Cover Generator

A web tool to help designing/drawing the cover of my EP "Microsongs".

## Constraints for the design

* Each second of the whole EP is represented by a pixel ;
* Each song is represented by a specific color.
* The EP will be 1600 seconds long, which will lead to a 40*40 pixels cover.

If a song is 60 seconds long, and is represented by the color red [ rgb(255, 0, 0) ], there must be exactly 60 red pixels on the cover. No more, no less.

## Libraries used 

* [Jquery](https://jquery.com/)
* [Spectrum Colorpicker](https://github.com/bgrins/spectrum)
